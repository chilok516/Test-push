name: model-switcher
description: Switch to specialized models for difficult tasks like deep coding debugging, complex analysis, or math. Use sessions_spawn with model override (e.g., openrouter/x-ai/grok-4.1-fast for coding) when default model struggles or task requires expert model strengths. Triggers: "debug this bug", "complex algorithm", "hard coding problem".
